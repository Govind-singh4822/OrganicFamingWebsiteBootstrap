        <br />
        <p><b>Introduction to starting organic farming in Uttarakhand:</b> The agriculture sector is one of the most important sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. In traditional India, the entire agricultural industry was run using organic techniques, where fertilizers and pesticides were obtained from plant and animal products. Rice, Wheat, Sugarcane, Maize, Soybeans, Pulses, Oilseeds, and various fruits and vegetables are the major crops grown in the state. It has 4 agro-climatic zones covering 6 high-altitude farming methods that mean that the state has the potential to grow different crops. Consumer demand for safe and healthy food has increased due to growing concerns over food quality, pollution due to chemicals, serious health hazards, and environmental issues. This growing demand has given rise to a new wave of agriculture, known as organic farming. 
     <br><br>   According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, the country is divided into three categories. The states of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and North Eastern have been placed in the first category. These are the states where the consumption of chemical fertilizers is less than other states. Thus, the government has decided to turn these states into organic agriculture states. Most of the hill farmers in Uttarakhand are deprived of resources and therefore use very few chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides. As a result, mountain soil is almost free of pesticide and chemical fertilizer residues. This is a very strong point for Uttarakhand to become a successful 'organic state'.

        <br><br>
          <h2 style="font-size: 38px"><b>Scope of Organic Framing in Uttrakhand</b></h2><br>
          
          <p>In organic farming, Uttarakhand is one of the leading states in India. The state also has a large number of certified organic farmers who are supported by the promotion of organic farming as well as with the help of a well-developed organizational structure for marketing organic cror products. The total area under organic farming in Uttarakhand is 16158.86 hectares. </p>
          <br />
          <p>Currently, the scope of organic farming is best in Uttarakhand as farmers use traditional methods of farming, i.e., rain-fed agriculture, without the use of pesticides or fertilizers. Along with the common farmers, the government is constantly taking active steps to make the state fully organic and with it increase the level of production. For promoting organic farming, the Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board (UOCB), the state's nodal agency was set up to promote sustainable development through organic farming.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>The following points further make it clear that the future of organic farming in Uttarakhand is very bright. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Uttarakhand has officially certified 23% of its total land for organic farming but the government is committed to increasing the certified percentage of land for organic farming in the state to 31% by the end of 2021. The Uttarakhand government has approved India's first Organic Agriculture Act for considering the prospects and scope of farming. The Act states that if farmers use pesticides or any type of prohibited fertilizer for their crops, they are subject to fines. It is commendable that about 40% of organic farming in India is done in Uttarakhand and the state sees the future of becoming a 'fully organic state' in the next 5 years. The Government of Uttarakhand is fully prepared to promote the organic market with the help of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) which will be under the control of the government to make farmers aware of the importance of organic farming and increase their scale of production. </p>
          <br><br>
          
          
          <h2><b>Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board (UOCB) </b></h2><br>
          <p>Organic farming is a manifestation of the patronage of the traditional environment of the people of Uttarakhand. Eighty percent of farmers in Uttarakhand are engaged in pre-determined organic farming in rain-fed conditions. This process has been a source of food security for small and backward farmers in terms of safe, plentiful, and nutritious food. Due to its diverse topography, the state has immense potential to promote herbs and medicinal plants cultivation through organic farming. However, it is unusable due to a lack of serious effort. The UOCB has been set up to work towards promoting the potential of organic farming in Uttarakhand. This is important to find the status of UOCB in organic farming. </p>
          
          
          <br><br>
          <h2><b>Functions of UOCB </b></h2>
          <br>
        <ol>
          <li>'Fill in the blanks' service UOCB helps organic farmers and connects them to the market by developing production plans based on market response. </li>
          <li>In organic farming, UOCB Internal Control System is used for compiles data generated by investigators and workers for the projection of next season's commodity production. The availability of updated data on a single window helps the marketing cell to plan for the supply chain. </li>
          <li>UOCB Resource Center provides up-to-date technical information for organic production. The technologies developed by the Board are communicated to the various stakeholders of the State. </li>
          <li>Finally, the UOCB Resource Generator is important to generate organic development resources in the form of finance, human resources, and building patronage. </li>
        </ol>
          <p>UOCB plays a major role in raising awareness among people about the benefits and importance of organic farming in Uttarakhand. </p>
        
          
          <h3><b>Recommendations / Suggestions in UOCB </b></h3>
          <br>
        <ol>
          <li>There is an urgent need to develop a market for organic crops to increase organic farming profitability. </li>
          <li>Inform the farmers about the benefits of organic farming as compared to conventional or modern farming through awareness programs conducted by governmental and non-governmental organizations. </li>
          <li>Make sure, provide better technical support to control pests and diseases. Currently, their ability to control some insects, such as stem borers, is very limited. </li>
          <li>Credit facility to farmers for access to bio-control agents through the board. </li>
          <li>To provide funds to the Board for the promotion of organic farming methods. </li>
          <li>Farmers' awareness about the certification process must be increased along with increasing their ability to fill in the required documents etc.</li>
          <li>Improve communication between boards, federations, and farmers. Farmers are most interested in market and price issues. </li>
          <li>Improving the efficiency of transportation and procurement systems to reduce product losses due to these inefficiencies. </li>
          </ol>
